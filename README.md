A presentation made in 15 minutes because I forgot to read the homework.


## Project Experience
The Project SDLC can be seen here [Piglulator SDL](https://github.com/Sillymoosey/Pigulator)

## Code and Architecture
The program uses mostly C# and HTML with a little javascript and CSS.

## Product Demo
https://pigulator.azurewebsites.net/

## Lessons Learn
Creating a console prototype was very helpful as it allowed me to see the hard code required to get the project idea up and running.

Not created a few extra test projects really hadicaped me later when I needed to overhaul my project as I had no other version to use to run test code on.

Azure decided to just work and that was a nice lucky break.

I would have wanted to know more about .NET Db's before implementing one.
